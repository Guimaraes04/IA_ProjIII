Mr. Asdrúbal has a traditional tavern, where he also sells some products. In his tavern, Mr. Asdrúbal keeps a list of his regular customers. These customers can spend money during the week and only pay in full at the end of the week. Whenever a new customer becomes a regular customer, a worker opens a new customer file, where the various expenses incurred and payments made are recorded. Each expense is associated with a product sold (consumed), a quantity, and has a date, total value and indication of whether it has already been paid or not, and on what date. The accountant issues an invoice/receipt whenever a customer makes a payment for one or more charges on their account.
In addition to the previous work, the accountant selects from a product table, which contains product information (name, unit price) and the quantity of that product in stock. Some restrictions imposed are: A customer can never have a total debt greater than €100; A customer should never have unpaid expenses for more than 15 days.
